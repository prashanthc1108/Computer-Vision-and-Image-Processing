# Computer-Vision-and-Image-Processing---CSE573

1 Implement Fourier Transform for 2D images and its Inverse Fourier Transform
2 Generate 5 levels of Laplacian pyramids and reconstruct the original image
3 Obrain Edges using Difference of Gaussian and Laplacian of Gaussian methods, and eliminate weak edges that do not have the first derivative support
4 Perform segmentation on an image using region merging technique that uses boundary melting
5 Compute disparity between pairs of stereo images using naive block matching method of varrying window sizes and dynamic programming approach
